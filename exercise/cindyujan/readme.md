Sure, here's a comparison of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Traditional Networking:

| Aspect | Software Defined Networking (SDN) | Traditional Networking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Architecture** | SDN is a networking architecture approach that enables the control and management of the network using software applications¹. | Traditional networking uses fixed and dedicated hardware devices such as routers and switches to control network traffic¹. |
| **Control Plane** | In SDN, the control plane manages network infrastructure and makes decisions about how network traffic should be handled¹. | In traditional networks, physical network devices, such as routers, switches, and firewalls, manage and direct network traffic¹. |
| **Configuration and Management** | SDN allows for more efficient network management, as network administrators can automate many tasks that would otherwise be done manually¹. | Traditional networks rely on standard networking protocols, such as TCP/IP and Ethernet, for communication between network devices¹. |
| **Programmability** | SDN improves performance by network virtualization. In SDN, software-controlled applications or APIs work as the basis of complete network management¹. | Traditional network is static and based on hardware network appliances¹. |
| **Scalability** | SDN allows for more flexible and customizable network configurations, as network infrastructure can be reconfigured on the fly¹. | Traditional network architecture was used by many companies till recent years but now a days due to its drawbacks Software Defined Network has been developed¹. |
| **Security** | SDN offers several key benefits over traditional networking approaches¹. | Inability to scale and network security and Performance are the major concern now a days in the current growing business situation¹. |
| **Cost** | SDN networks are becoming increasingly popular due to their flexibility, automation, and cost-effectiveness¹. | While traditional networks are still widely used¹. |

Please note that the specifics can vary based on the implementation and use case. For more detailed information, you may need to access the full text of the articles¹.

Sure, here's a comparison table based on the articles I found:

| Author | Year of Publication | Article | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keith Townsend¹ | 2016¹ | A closer look at SDN vs. traditional networking¹ | SDN allows network engineers and admins to respond quickly to changing business environments¹. SDN products can combine the power of big data analytics and traditional networking, allowing them to monitor traffic flows and network latency¹. | There are disadvantages of software-defined networking¹. |
| Not mentioned² | 2021² | Comparative Analysis of Traditional and Software Defined Networks² | SDN significantly simplifies network management tasks. It enables complex network configuration and controlling easy through a programmable and flexible interface². | Traditional IP networks are very difficult to manage and troubleshoot. They are error-prone and it is difficult to introduce new features and development of a new set of policies². |

Please note that this is a simplified comparison and both SDN and traditional networks have their own complexities and use-cases¹².

Sure, here is the description in markdown format:

```
# Software Defined Networking (SDN)

The image provided is a diagram illustrating the structure of Software Defined Networking (SDN). Here are the key components:

- **Applications**: These are part of the Control Plane and interact with the SDN Controller.
- **SDN Controller**: This is the central unit that communicates with both the Applications in the Control Plane and the SDN Datapath in the Data Plane.
- **SDN Datapath**: This is part of the Data Plane and is connected to the Switches.
- **Switches**: These are also part of the Data Plane and are connected to a Pool of Application Servers.
- **Pool of Application Servers**: This represents the servers that the Switches are connected to.

The diagram shows the interaction between these components, indicating the flow of communication or control. The Applications communicate with the SDN Controller, which in turn communicates with the SDN Datapath and Switches, showing the path of data flow or command execution. The Switches are connected to the Pool of Application Servers. All entities are interconnected, showing that they communicate with each other in some way. 

Please note that this is a high-level overview. The actual implementation details may vary based on the specific SDN solution.
