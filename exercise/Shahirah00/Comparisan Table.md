I'm sorry, but I was only able to find information on 5 papers related to heritage microclimate monitoring. Here is a comparison table with the available information:

| Author | Title | Idea | Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Luigi Germinario et al. | [Microclimate and Weathering in Cultural Heritage: Design of a Monitoring Apparatus for Field Exposure Tests](^1^) | An innovative experimental method for the long-term monitoring of outdoor microclimate and material decay at cultural heritage sites | An apparatus for field exposure tests was designed to monitor a variety of historical building materials in different environmental settings. The data series acquired are compared with the corresponding meteorological datasets on a local and regional scale |
| Francesca Frasca et al. | [Strategies for the deployment of microclimate sensors in spaces housing collections](^2^) | This paper describes specific procedures aimed at the deployment of microclimate sensors in spaces housing collections (e.g., museums) under different scenarios | The decision making involves a multidisciplinary discussion among museum manager, conservator and conservation scientist and implies five steps |
| Not specified | Atmosphere | Special Issue : Microclimate of the Heritage Buildings](^3^) | Discusses the importance of studying and monitoring the microclimate for the conservation conditions of heritage buildings | Not specified |
| A. Bonora, K. Fabbri | [Two new indices for preventive conservation of the cultural heritage](^4^) | This paper presents two new indices for preventive conservation of the cultural heritage | The indices are calculated starting from the data from any microclimate monitoring campaign, or they are obtained through virtual simulation |
| Not specified | [Conservation risks for paper collections induced by the microclimate](^5^) | Discusses the conservation risks for paper collections induced by the microclimate | The microclimate conditions were monitored only in the major block of the repository |
