I found a website that provides an overview of the future of object detection. The article explains that object detection is breaking into a wide range of industries, including computer vision, image retrieval, security, surveillance, automated vehicle systems, and machine inspection. Although the possibilities are endless when it comes to future use cases for object detection, there are still significant challenges remaining ³. Another paper proposes a new method for future object detection with spatiotemporal transformers. The paper experiments with three different mechanisms that enable the network to spatiotemporally process multiple frames, and provides ego-motion information to the model in a learnable manner. The authors show that both of these extensions improve the future object detection performance substantially ⁴. I hope this helps!
