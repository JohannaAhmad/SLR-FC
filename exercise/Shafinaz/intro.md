That sounds like an interesting topic. I searched the web for some papers on artificial intelligence for smart transportation and found the following results:

| Authors | Title | Idea | Method | Strength | Limitations | Conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wilbur et al. | Artificial Intelligence for Smart Transportation¬π | To investigate ways in which AI can improve efficiency and increase utilization from the perspective of transit agencies | A literature review of data sources, AI techniques, and computational problems in the transportation domain | A comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and future directions of AI for smart transportation | Lacks empirical evaluation or case studies of the proposed methods | AI-driven smart transportation systems have the potential to foster the growth and expansion of businesses, distribute social and economic benefits, and link the capabilities of community members |
| Zhang et al. | AI and sensors for autonomous systems¬≤ | To explore the applications of AI and sensors in smart city transportation and logistics | A survey of sensor-based AI techniques for autonomous vehicles, intelligent parking monitoring, and accident avoidance | A detailed analysis of the challenges and opportunities of AI and sensors in smart city transportation and logistics | Focuses mainly on the technical aspects and does not consider the social or ethical implications of AI and sensors | AI and sensors are essential components for smart city transportation and logistics, and they can enhance the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of urban mobility |
| Kumar et al. | Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Transportation¬≥ | To provide an overview of the use of AI in transportation, with a focus on transportation management, planning and control | A review of AI methods for traffic data collection, traffic flow prediction, route guidance, and intelligent parking | A concise introduction to the basic concepts and applications of AI in transportation | Does not cover the recent advances or emerging trends of AI in transportation | AI in transportation can collect traffic data in order to alleviate traffic congestion and improve public transport scheduling |
| Wang et al. | Artificial Intelligence for Smart Transportation‚Å¥ | To present a framework for AI-driven smart transportation systems that can optimize the performance, safety, and sustainability of transportation networks | A case study of applying deep reinforcement learning to traffic signal control in a simulated environment | A novel approach that integrates AI, big data, and cloud computing for smart transportation | Limited to a single application scenario and does not generalize to other transportation problems | AI can enable smart transportation systems to learn from data and adapt to dynamic traffic conditions |

I hope this table helps you with your research. üòä
