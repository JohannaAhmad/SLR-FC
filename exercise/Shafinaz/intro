Sure, I can suggest some articles that discuss how artificial intelligence can be used for smart villages. Here are five articles that I found from the web:

- [What role does AI play in Smart Cities and Smart Villages?](^1^): This article explores the research questions and projects related to AI and digitalization in urban and rural areas, conducted by Fraunhofer ISI, a leading institute for innovation research in Germany.
- [Artificial Intelligence for Smart Cities and Villages: Advanced Technologies, Development, and Challenges](^2^): This book summarizes the role of AI in planning and designing smart solutions for urban and rural environments, and presents effective solutions to various challenges, such as smart farms, indoor object classification, smart transportation, block chains, humanoid robots, and IoT devices.
- [Enhancing Smart Home Design with AI and IoT: A Case Study](^3^): This paper presents a case study of a living space that shows how AI models and IoT devices can be used to improve the development of a smart house, and how they can enhance the comfort, security, and energy efficiency of the residents.
- [Artificial Intelligence for Smart Cities and Villages: Advanced Technologies, Development, and Challenges](^4^): This press release announces the publication of the book mentioned above, and highlights some of the concepts and applications of AI for smart cities and villages.
- [Artificial Intelligence for Smart Cities and Villages: Advanced Technologies, Development, and Challenges](^5^): This is the official webpage of the book mentioned above, where you can find more information about the book, such as the table of contents, the authors, and the publisher.

I hope these articles are helpful for you. ðŸ˜Š
