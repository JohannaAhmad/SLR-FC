Certainly! Here are 5 recent articles on job and skill recommendation systems:

“Job Recommender Systems: A Review” by Corné de Ruijt and Sandjai Bhulai 1. This paper provides a review of the job recommender system literature published in the past decade (2011-2021). It puts more emphasis on contributions that incorporate the temporal and reciprocal nature of job recommendations. The authors suggest that taking such views into account in the design of the JRS can lead to improved model performance.

“SkillRec: A Data-Driven Approach to Job Skill Recommendation for Career Development” by Yashaswi Verma, et al2. This paper proposes and develops the Skill Recommendation (SkillRec) system for recommending the relevant job skills required for a given job based on the job title. SkillRec collects and identifies the skill set required for a job based on the job descriptions published by companies hiring for these roles.

“SkillRec: A Data-Driven Approach to Job Skill Recommendation for Career Development” by Yashaswi Verma, et al3. As part of SkillRec, the authors develop two approaches to skill recommendation, utilizing word/sentence embedding techniques (using BERT and FastText) for job title representation, before inputting this job title representation to a simple but effective feed-forward neural network for job skill recommendation.

Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a comparison table of three papers on recommender systems:

| **Authors** | **Title** | **Idea** | **Method** | **Strength** | **Limitations** | **Conclusion** |
|-------------|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Deepjyoti Roy & Mala Dutta | A systematic review and research perspective on recommender systems | The paper aims to undergo a systematic review on various recent contributions in the domain of recommender systems, focusing on diverse applications like books, movies, products, etc. | Algorithmic analysis | Provides a much-needed overview of the current state of research in this field and points out the existing gaps and challenges to help posterity in developing an efficient recommender system | Recommender systems suffer from various limitations and challenges like scalability, cold-start, sparsity, etc. | Recommender systems are efficient tools for filtering online information, which is widespread owing to the changing habits of computer users, personalization trends, and emerging access to the internet. |
| Gediminas Adomavicius & Alexander Tuzhilin | Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions | The paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art in recommender systems research and identifies the current trends and future challenges. | Survey | Provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art in recommender systems research and identifies the current trends and future challenges | Recommender systems are still far from being perfect and there is a need for more research in this field | Recommender systems have become an integral part of e-commerce and online services. |
| Robin Burke | Hybrid Web Recommender Systems | The paper presents a survey of hybrid web recommender systems, which combine content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. | Survey | Hybrid web recommender systems are more effective than pure content-based or collaborative filtering systems | Hybrid web recommender systems require more computational resources than pure content-based or collaborative filtering systems | Hybrid web recommender systems are an effective way to improve the accuracy of recommendations. |

I hope this helps!
