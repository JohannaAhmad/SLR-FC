The image you provided is a graphical representation of the "Octalysis" framework, a gamification model that categorizes various game design elements into eight core drives to analyze and build strategies around user engagement and motivation. 

The central element is an octagonal diagram labeled "OCTALYSIS," with each side representing one of the eight core drives of user motivation in gamification:

1. **Meaning** - Epic Meaning & Calling
2. **Empowerment** - Creativity & Feedback
3. **Social Influence** - Social Pressure & Envy
4. **Unpredictability** - Uncertainty & Curiosity
5. **Avoidance** - Loss & Avoidance
6. **Scarcity** - Impatience & Scarcity
7. **Ownership** - Ownership & Possession
8. **Accomplishment** - Development & Accomplishment

Surrounding the octagon are lists of specific game design techniques associated with each core drive. For example, under "Accomplishment," there are items like "Status Point," "Badges," and "Leaderboard." Under “Ownership,” examples include “Virtual Goods” and “Build from Scratch.”

The color scheme consists of different shades of blue, making it visually appealing and easy to differentiate between sections. Please note that the text in the image is not in English, but the concepts remain the same. For a comprehensive understanding, I recommend reading more about the Octalysis framework.
