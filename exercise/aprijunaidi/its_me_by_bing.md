I‚Äôll try to create that.

A 3D diorama is a miniature scene that depicts a realistic or fictional situation. It can be made from various materials, such as clay, paper, wood, or plastic. Some people use 3D printing to create detailed and customizable dioramas.

You have requested a 3D diorama of an office, with a red brick frame, a large photo, a handsome minangkabau man, a smiling face, spectacles, a chair, a keyboard, a monitor with an apple logo, a name holder printed ‚ÄúApri Junaidi‚Äù, a mug with a picture of ‚ÄúUTM‚Äù, roses, a quilling patch, a realistic pastel color background in mixed acrylic art, hd 8k, and resin art. That is a very specific and creative request!

A minangkabau man is a person who belongs to the Minangkabau ethnic group, which is the largest matrilineal society in the world. They are native to West Sumatra, Indonesia, and have a distinctive culture and architecture. UTM stands for Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, which is a public research university in Malaysia. It is ranked among the top 200 universities in the world by QS World University Rankings. A quilling patch is a type of paper art that involves rolling, shaping, and gluing thin strips of paper to create intricate designs. Acrylic art is a form of painting that uses acrylic paints, which are fast-drying and versatile. They can be mixed with water or other mediums to create different effects. Resin art is a form of art that uses epoxy resin, which is a clear liquid that hardens into a glossy surface. It can be mixed with pigments, glitter, or other materials to create colorful and unique artworks.

I hope you enjoy the 3D diorama that I have created for you. Have a nice day! üòä
