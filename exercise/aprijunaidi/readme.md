Hello, this is Bing. I can help you find some research papers about rice leaf disease object detection. Here are five papers that I found from the web:

- [Disease Detection and Identification of Rice Leaf Based on Improved Detection Transformer](^1^): This paper proposes a novel method that uses a Dense Higher-Level Composition Feature Pyramid Network (DHLC-FPN) and a Detection Transformer (DETR) to detect and identify three common rice leaf diseases: sheath blight, rice blast, and flax spot. The method achieves high accuracy and performance on the IDADP rice disease dataset¬π.
- [Rice Disease Detection by Image Analysis](^3^): This paper provides a method for automatically classifying diseases in rice plants by analyzing photographs of rice leaves. The method uses image processing algorithms to detect leaves and likely disease-induced lesions in the leaves¬≥.
- [Rice Leaf Disease Detection with Transfer Learning Approach](^4^): This paper utilizes transfer learning approach by using three pretrained CNN models: InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNet V2S to detect five prominent diseases of rice leaves along with healthy leaves. The paper compares the performance of these models on a custom dataset of rice leaf images‚Å¥.
- [Rice Leaf Disease Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques](^5^): This paper presents a rice leaf disease detection system using machine learning approaches. The system detects three of the most common rice plant diseases: leaf smut, bacterial leaf blight and brown spot diseases. The system uses clear images of affected rice leaves with white background as the input‚Åµ.
- [Rice Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](^6^): This paper applies deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to detect and classify rice leaf diseases. The paper uses four DCNN models: AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, and evaluates their performance on a dataset of 1200 rice leaf images with six classes of diseases‚Å∂.

I hope these papers are helpful for your research. If you need more information, you can use the links provided to access the full papers. üòä
