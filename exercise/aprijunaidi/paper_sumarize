Here is a summary of part 1 of the current web page:

- **Title and authors**: The article is titled "Deep learning based object detection for resource constrained devices: Systematic review, future trends and challenges ahead" and is written by Vidya Kamath and Renuka A. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Manipal Institute of Technology, India¹[1].
- **Objective**: The article aims to identify current trends in resource-constrained applications for deep learning-based object detectors in terms of the technique used to create the model, the type of input image involved, the type of device used, and the type of application addressed by the model²[2].
- **Method**: The article uses a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to collect, critically assess, integrate, and present data from 167 studies on the topic³[3]. The SLR follows the PRISMA guidelines and defines four research questions to guide the analysis.
- **Conclusion**: The article discusses the gaps, possibilities, and future perspectives discovered throughout the research process, implying that this field of study has grown profoundly in the last decade⁴[4].
