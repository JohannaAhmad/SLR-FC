Here is a summary of part 1 of the current web page:

- **Title and authors**: The article is titled "Deep learning based object detection for resource constrained devices: Systematic review, future trends and challenges ahead" and is written by Vidya Kamath and Renuka A. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Manipal Institute of Technology, India¹[1].
- **Objective**: The article aims to identify current trends in resource-constrained applications for deep learning-based object detectors in terms of the technique used to create the model, the type of input image involved, the type of device used, and the type of application addressed by the model²[2].
- **Method**: The article uses a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to collect, critically assess, integrate, and present data from 167 studies on the topic³[3]. The SLR follows the PRISMA guidelines and defines four research questions to guide the analysis.
- **Conclusion**: The article discusses the gaps, possibilities, and future perspectives discovered throughout the research process, implying that this field of study has grown profoundly in the last decade⁴[4].

Paper weakness :

Here are some of the weaknesses of this article:

- **Lack of empirical evaluation**: The article does not provide any empirical results or experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models or techniques for object detection on resource-constrained devices. It only relies on literature review and analysis, which may not reflect the actual performance or challenges in real-world scenarios.
- **Limited scope of literature sources**: The article mainly focuses on the studies published in four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed Central, and ArXiv) and excludes other potential sources of relevant literature, such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, etc. This may lead to missing some important or recent works in the field of object detection on resource-constrained devices.
- **Lack of comparison or discussion of trade-offs**: The article does not provide any comparison or discussion of the trade-offs between different approaches or models for object detection on resource-constrained devices, such as accuracy, speed, memory, power consumption, etc. It only lists and summarizes the existing works without critically evaluating their strengths and weaknesses or suggesting possible improvements or directions for future research.
