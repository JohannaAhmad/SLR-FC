This image is an infographic explaining how Instagram uses machine learning to personalize user feeds. It shows the process from user interaction to the personalized feed, involving steps like processing server, information storage, and learning model. Here are some key points:

- **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the Instagram app on their smartphone, such as liking, commenting, or following other accounts.
- **Request Processing Server**: The user's actions are sent to a server that processes the requests and stores the information in a database.
- **Information Storage - SQL**: The database keeps track of the user's activities and engagement with other accounts, such as how often they view, like, or comment on their posts.
- **Learning Model**: The learning model uses the data from the database to predict the user's preferences and interests, and to rank the posts that are most relevant and appealing to them.
- **Personalized Feed**: The user sees a personalized feed on their app, based on the ranking and classification of the posts by the learning model.
- **Data of User Analytics**: The user's analytics data, such as how long they spend on the app, what posts they interact with, and what ads they click on, are also collected and shared with third parties for further analysis or monetization.
