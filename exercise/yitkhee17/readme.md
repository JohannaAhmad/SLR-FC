I can try to summarize the abstract of the above articles for you, but please note that this is not a substitute for reading the original papers. Here are the summaries:

- [Checks and Strategies for Enabling Code-Switched Machine Translation](^1^): This paper proposes methods to measure and improve the ability of multilingual NMT models to handle code-switched text, using Malay-English as one of the test languages.
- [Malay-English Neural Machine Translation System](^2^): This paper presents a tool to translate an English sentence into Malay and vice versa, using a transformer-based NMT model trained on a parallel corpus of Malay and English texts.
- [Neural Machine Translation with Code](^3^): This paper provides a tutorial on how to implement a simple NMT model using Python and Keras, with examples of English-German translation. The same code can be adapted for Malay-English translation with appropriate data and parameters.
- [Neural Machine Translation for Sinhala-English Code-Mixed Text](^4^): This paper proposes a data augmentation technique to improve the performance of NMT for Sinhala-English code-mixed text, which is similar to Malay-English code-mixed text in terms of linguistic features and challenges.
- [A Neural Machine Translation Approach for Translating Malay Parliament Proceedings into English]: This paper describes a NMT system for translating Malay parliament proceedings into English, using a transformer-based NMT model trained on a large-scale parallel corpus of Malay and English texts.

I hope these summaries are helpful to you. üòä

I can try to do a comparison of the articles in table format, but please note that this is not a substitute for reading the original papers. Here is the table that I created using the information from the abstracts and my web search tool:

| Title | Keywords | Idea | Method | Strength | Limitation | Conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Checks and Strategies for Enabling Code-Switched Machine Translation¬π | code-switching, multilingual NMT, Malay-English | To measure and improve the ability of multilingual NMT models to handle code-switched text | Using a set of checks and strategies, such as data filtering, data augmentation, and model adaptation | Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods on four code-switched language pairs, including Malay-English | Focusing only on multilingual NMT models and not comparing with bilingual or pivot-based models | Providing useful insights and guidelines for enabling code-switched machine translation |
| Malay-English Neural Machine Translation System¬≤ | Malay-English, NMT, transformer, parallel corpus | To present a tool to translate an English sentence into Malay and vice versa | Using a transformer-based NMT model trained on a parallel corpus of Malay and English texts | Achieving high BLEU scores and outperforming existing online translation tools | Not evaluating the quality of the translations by human judges or on different domains or genres | Developing a user-friendly and accurate Malay-English NMT system |
| Neural Machine Translation with Code¬≥ | NMT, Python, Keras, tutorial | To provide a tutorial on how to implement a simple NMT model using Python and Keras | Using a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism and beam search, with examples of English-German translation | Explaining the code and the concepts in a clear and step-by-step manner | Not covering advanced topics or techniques, such as transformer, BPE, or multilingual NMT | Offering a practical and accessible introduction to NMT with code |
| Neural Machine Translation for Sinhala-English Code-Mixed Text‚Å¥ | Sinhala-English, code-mixed, NMT, data augmentation | To propose a data augmentation technique to improve the performance of NMT for Sinhala-English code-mixed text | Using a rule-based approach to generate synthetic code-mixed data and adding them to the training data | Improving the BLEU score and the fluency of the translations | Relying on manual rules and not considering the context or the semantics of the code-mixing | Presenting a novel and effective method for enhancing NMT for code-mixed text |
| A Neural Machine Translation Approach for Translating Malay Parliament Proceedings into English‚Åµ | Malay-English, NMT, transformer, parliament proceedings | To describe a NMT system for translating Malay parliament proceedings into English | Using a transformer-based NMT model trained on a large-scale parallel corpus of Malay and English texts | Producing fluent and accurate translations and outperforming a phrase-based statistical machine translation system | Not providing a detailed analysis or evaluation of the translations or comparing with other NMT models | Developing a state-of-the-art NMT system for a specific and important domain |

I hope this table is helpful to you. üòä
