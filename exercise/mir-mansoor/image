This image is an infographic explaining how Instagram uses machine learning to personalize user feeds. It outlines the process from user interaction to the personalized feed, 
involving steps like processing server, records of user activities, information storage, and learning model.
The title "How Instagram Uses Machine Learning!" is prominently displayed at the top. 
A hand holding a smartphone with the Instagram logo represents "User Interaction". Arrows lead from "User Interaction" to a series of steps
including: "Request Processing Server" depicted by server racks, "Records of User Activities (Engagement)" shown as a ticket, 
"Information Storage - SQL" represented by databases, and a central element titled “Learning Model” connected to a light 
bulb icon indicating the prediction process. The outcome is a “Personalized Feed” represented by different types of 
content icons inside a square outline. There’s also an arrow leading from “Learning Model” to “Classification on Feature
Extraction”, and another leading down to “Data of User Analytics”, depicted as a lab flask, which then connects to “Third Party”,
illustrated by server racks again.
