Here is a summary of the article:

- Patent-KG: Patent Knowledge Graph Extraction for Engineering Design**¹[1]. This article proposes a new method to build a patent-based knowledge graph, 
patent-KG, that can represent the knowledge facts in patents for engineering design²[2].
- Unsupervised method using attention mechanism in language models**⁴[4]. The article uses an unsupervised method to extract knowledge facts from patent
abstracts, by searching the attention graph in language models such as BERT³[3]. The extracted entities and relationships are compared with other benchmarks
in terms of recall rate and coverage⁵[5].
- Evaluation and results**. The article evaluates the quality and usefulness of patent-KG by comparing it with other engineering knowledge sources, such as
WordNet, ConceptNet, B-link, and TechNet. The results show that patent-KG achieves the highest recall rate of 0.82 in the standard list of mechanical
engineering related technical terms, and covers more engineering specific knowledge than other methods⁶[6].
- Limitations and future work**. The article acknowledges that the method does not perform well on passive sentences and very long sentences, 
and suggests that fine-tuning the language models and combining the attention mechanism with syntactic rules can improve the quality and coverage 
of the knowledge graph. The article also discusses the potential applications of patent-KG for knowledge reuse and generation in engineering design.

paper weakness:

The paper does not discuss the weakness of their proposed method, but based on the contents some possible weaknesses are:

- The method relies on the attention mechanism of BERT, which may not capture all the relevant relationships between technical terms in patents.
- The method does not perform well on passive sentences and very long sentences, which are common in patent texts
- The method does not consider the semantic similarity or hierarchy of technical terms, which may affect the quality of the knowledge graph.
