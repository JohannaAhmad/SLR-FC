The given framework outlines a structured approach to research in the field of Cloud Forensics (CF). The process is divided into three distinct phases, each with its own set of steps that build upon one another to advance the research from initial conception to conclusion.

In Phase 1, the research begins with a broad "Start" and narrows its focus as it progresses. It starts with foundational research into "Cloud Computing" and "Digital Forensic," setting the stage for a deeper investigation into the specialized domain of "Cloud Forensic (CF)." This initial stage is crucial for gathering existing knowledge through a "Literature Review," which informs the subsequent "Problem Formulation." This phase aims to organize the cloud forensic domain by identifying gaps in the existing literature and frameworks for CF, eventually leading to the "Establishing [of a] Standard Framework" for cloud forensics. This sets a baseline for consistency and best practices in the field.

Phase 2 delves into the specifics of methodology with a focus on simplification and homogeneity, aiming to create a unified approach to cloud forensic research. "Data Preprocessing" is essential at this stage to ensure the data is clean, relevant, and structured, leading to "Normalization," which facilitates comparability and analysis. This phase also includes the development of "Digital Forensic Cloud Frameworks," where objectives are defined and a "Conceptual Framework" is developed. This involves proposing a common concept, developing a meta-model based on that concept, and then validating and evaluating this meta-model to ensure it meets the objectives set forth.

Phase 3 is the implementation phase, where the conceptual work and planning are put into practice. An "Implementation" of the frameworks and models developed in Phase 2 is carried out, followed by an "Evaluation" to assess their effectiveness and applicability in real-world scenarios. The classification of CF concepts is critical at this stage to ensure a clear understanding and application of the research. Finally, the research culminates in the "Writing [of the] Thesis," where all findings are documented, and the research is presented in a formal academic format. The process concludes with a "Conceptual Framework," summarizing the research contribution to the field of cloud forensics, signifying the "End" of the research journey.
