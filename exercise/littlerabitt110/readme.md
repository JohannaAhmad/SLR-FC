Certainly! Here is the abstract for the paper titled **Low-Light Image Enhancement: A Comparative Review and Prospects** ¹:

> Low-light image enhancement is a key prerequisite for diverse applications in the field of image processing and computer vision. Various approaches for this task have been introduced over last few decades, and the current state of the art methods have shown remarkable advances based on deep neural networks. However, there are still technical issues to be resolved, e.g., dependency on subjective re-touching results and inconsistency with subjective evaluations. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview and a practical guide for experts as well as beginners. This paper covers a systematic taxonomy of existing algorithms, representative methodologies, and the performance analysis on benchmark datasets. To pave the way of the development direction for low-light image enhancement, constructive discussions and prospects are also provided ¹.

I hope this helps!

Certainly! The image you sent is an infographic that explains how Instagram uses machine learning to personalize user feeds. The infographic outlines the process from user interaction to the personalized feed, involving steps like processing server, records of user activities, information storage, and learning model. The title "How Instagram Uses Machine Learning!" is prominently displayed at the top. A hand holding a smartphone with the Instagram logo represents "User Interaction." Arrows lead from "User Interaction" to a blue and green "Processing Server" icon representing request processing. The next step is "Records of User Activities (Engagement)," depicted by a red ticket icon. Information is then stored in SQL as shown by a database symbol labeled "Information Storage - SQL." A golden trophy icon labeled “Learning Model” indicates the machine learning process that analyzes and learns from the data. The “Prediction Process” is represented by a purple tag icon leading to “Personalized Feed,” shown as a female avatar with various social media icons around her head. There’s also an indication of “Data of User Analytics” being collected, represented by a pink flask icon. Lastly, there’s an indication that data can be shared with third parties, represented by blue stacked cubes ¹.
