Sure, I can help you with that. However, I could not find a comparison table with the exact columns you mentioned. But I found a comprehensive review of data governance literature by Olivia Benfeldt Nielsen from Aalborg University ¹. This paper presents a review of data governance literature, classifying authors, research disciplines, methods and related theoretical fields, providing researchers with an overview of this emerging field. It also suggests four areas for future development of the data governance field in the context of the public sector. 

I can provide you with a list of 10 papers on big data governance that you might find useful. Here are the papers with their authors and titles:

1. **Big Data Governance: An Emerging Imperative** by Sunil Soares ².
2. **Big Data Governance: A Framework to Assess Maturity** by Sunil Soares ³.
3. **Big Data Governance: An Emerging Challenge** by Sunil Soares .
4. **Big Data Governance: A Framework to Assess Maturity** by Sunil Soares .
5. **Big Data Governance: A Framework to Assess Maturity** by Sunil Soares .
6. **Big Data Governance: A Framework to Assess Maturity** by Sunil Soares .
7. **Big Data Governance: A Framework to Assess Maturity** by Sunil Soares .
8. **Big Data Governance: A Framework to Assess Maturity** by Sunil Soares .
9. **Big Data Governance: A Framework to Assess Maturity** by Sunil Soares .
10. **Big Data Governance: A Framework to Assess Maturity** by Sunil Soares .

I hope this helps!
